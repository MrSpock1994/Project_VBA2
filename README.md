# Project_VBA2
Projects developed in VBA in order to automate work tasks

I developed this project from scratch, basically i had to access an excel sheet which serve as a database, and filter the cases where the finance team had some action.
The process was divided in 2 major steps:
Step 1 - Here is where i treated the data from the initial database, the code for this can be found in the files named update1 and updated2. F
Step 2 - After treating the data in order to provide to the financial team the information as they need it, i developed some functions so the excel sheet would be
ready to be upload in the company system. 
This was a very important project, mainly because the idea behind it envolves costs which affect directly the financial performance of the company
